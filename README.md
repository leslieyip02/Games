# Tetris
Recreating tetris with HTML, CSS and JS

### Description
*Tetris* is a puzzle game created in the 80s, and has seen numerous iterations over the years. The game periodically drops blocks on to a grid, and the player is able to move the blocks to the left or right, or rotate the piece. When a row in the grid is filled, it clears that line and the blocks in the row above are translated downwards. The game ends when the blocks reach the top of the grid. My version uses a HTML canvas to render the game, and JS to control the game logic.
